# Recap
- Basic physics of Xray generation
- Xrays come from a vaccum tube
# X-ray Physics
## Interaction of X-ray photon with matter
- This is the most important for AI applications
- Two ways of interaction:
	- Photo-electric Effect
		- X-ray photon energy is greater than the binding energy of an electron

Next tuesday, there will be an orientation about the first project. Specifics will be provided and an overview of the 

- The scatter grid helps reduce scattered radiation, however if it is stationary it will prodice artifacts on the final output image
- To remedy this, the scatter grid moves very quickly during imaging, effectlvely shifting it's shadow around the entire image and not
